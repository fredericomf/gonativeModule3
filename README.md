# gonativeModule3

Module 3 of Rocketseat React Native Course

This work environment was prepared using the same tutorial of Module 1 and 2, reproduced below:

## Initial instructions

1. Read and follow the steps described on top level directory.

2. To create a react native new project run:

```bash
$ react-native init [NAME OF PROJECT]
```

### Point of attention

When a native library is linked to project, we must to run, again, "react-native run-android". Otherwise the project runs with: "react-native start"

Generally link library command is like this: "react-native link ..."

### RESETING CACHE

Sometimes, when a red message rose up in device, is necessary to reset our cache running the following command:

```bash
react-native start --reset-cache
```

_NOTICE: This command result a long time to deploy(almost the same of the first time)_

### LIVE RELOAD

To live reload, shake your device and set 'Enable Live Reload'

7. Choose option named: 'Airbnb'
8. Choose option named: 'Json'
9. Confirm with 'Y' and wait the installation process
10. Delete package-lock.json from your project
11. Run yarn on your project
    NOTE: If you get a permission error to write on node_modules directory use:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER [Path to your node_modules]
```

12. Install babel-eslint

```bash
yarn add babel-eslint -D
```

13. On VSCode press CTRL+SHIFT+P then write 'json' to Open Settings. The following statements must be present, if not set it:

```javascript
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
"prettier.eslintIntegration": true,
```

15. Configure .eslintrc.json like this:

```javascript
{
  "parser": "babel-eslint",
  "env": {
    "es6": true
  },
  "extends": "airbnb",
  "globals": {
    "Atomics": "readonly",
    "SharedArrayBuffer": "readonly"
  },
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaFeatures": {
      "jsx": true
    },
    "ecmaVersion": 2018,
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "plugins": ["react"],
  "rules": {
    "react/jsx-filename-extension": [
      "error",
      { "extensions": [".js", ".jsx"] }
    ],
    "import/prefer-default-export": "off"
  }
}
```

## REACT-DEVTOOLS

A tool to inspect code on React and React Native

```bash
yarn add react-devtools --dev
```

Add the following script to package.json:

```javascript
"react-devtool": "react-devtools"
```

Run the command (must be 'react-native run-android' running):

```bash
yarn run react-devtool
```

STUDY_NOTES: If devtools is waiting for connection and nothings happen, try to run this command. Then try restart 'react-native run-android':

```bash
adb reverse tcp:8097 tcp:8097
```

See configuration file to more details: **DevToolsConfig.js**

## BABEL-PLUGIN-ROOT-IMPORT

This plugin help us to work easily with imports

```bash
yarn add babel-plugin-root-import -D
```

Set the .babelrc to:

```javascript
{
  "presets": ["module:metro-react-native-babel-preset"],
  "plugins": [
    [
      "babel-plugin-root-import",
      {
        "rootPathSuffix": "src"
      }
    ]
  ],
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "plugins": [
        [
          "babel-plugin-root-import",
          {
            "rootPathSuffix": "src"
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

STUDY_NOTES: This plugin let me able to use '~/path-to-implementation' than '../../../path/path2/etc...'. An example can be found at '/src/index.js'.

To resolve error warning of eslint (on using root plugin):

```bash
yarn add eslint-plugin-import eslint-import-resolver-babel-plugin-root-import -D
```

After installed this plugin, add "settings" node at '.eslintrc.json':

```javascript
  "settings": {
    "import/resolver":{
      "babel-plugin-root-import":{}
    }
  }
```

To use auto-complete paths on project using babel-root-import.

1. Create the file '/jsconfig.json'
2. Write the following content:

```javascript
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "~/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## REACT-NAVIGATION

This package is used to manage routes in React Native

Installing:

```bash
yarn add react-navigation react-native-gesture-handler
```

STUDY_NOTE: Note that has one more package being installed with react-navigation, this package will be used to manage the gestures from user's fingers.

After installed react-native-gesture-handler, is necessary to install it natively:

```bash
react-native link react-native-gesture-handler
```

IMPORTANT: Linking a package is necessary run 'react-native run-android' even 'react-native start'. This allows native packages to be visible to our app.

STUDY_NOTE: If any error message rose up in android try to run: 'react-native start --reset-cache

## AXIOS

Plugin to manage requests

```bash
yarn add axios
```

STUDY_NOTE: An example of use can be found in ~/services/api.js

## REACT NATIVE STATUS BAR HEIGHT

It's a plugin used to define the sistema statusbar height

```bash
yarn add react-native-status-bar-height
```

## REACT NATIVE VECTOR ICONS

This is the best way to work with icons in React Native.

```bash
yarn add react-native-vector-icons
```

It's some dependencies that we must to link natively, then:

```bash
react-native link react-native-vector-icons
```

After:

```bash
react-native run-android
```
